First encountered in Gamma Draconis when the Shivans assaulted the 8th SOC Battlegroup guarding the Mutara Jump Node, the Scylla is the most fearsome corvette in the Shivan arsenal. Extremely fast, well-armed and heavily armored against our weapons, it is a dire threat to our cruisers and corvettes, and can lash out against destroyers with its heavy forward cannon. Fortunately, the integrity of its weapons is rather weak and its point defense armament is relatively poor, with only a handful of laser turrets and a pair of AAA beams.
