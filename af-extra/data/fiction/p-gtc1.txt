Named after the ill-fated cruiser that encountered the Shivans in their second invasion, the Vigilant is the first prototype cruiser developed under the 'Proteuz Mandate' and two of these were built for the 7th Battlegroup. Although this cruiser does not house a single beam cannon, it does have 2 Antimatter Cannons, 7 dual-mounted heavy pulse cannons, 7 light pulse turrets and 4 anti-fighter beams. The design was clear that it is intended as fleet escort from enemy bombers and attacking fighters. Cruisers were once used for quick assault because of their speed and maneuverability but since new corvettes are quick to be deployed, faster and handles pretty well, the new cruisers are limited to protection or tactical role. The size of the Vigilant and the lack of a beam weapon is deceptive for it is a true nightmare for any attacking fighter.
