I am not use to this. Capturing high profile criminals. As a mercenary, we had job orders from private corporations but we had clients from the 'underground' as well and they paid better. Now that I'm with the law enforcement, I may have to kill or apprehend my former clients and most of them were my friends. Can you begin to imagine the conflict and mixed emotions? I am sure this Renasky person may have been my boss way, way back. I hoped he does not recognize me or I will surely be marked for death and hunted down by the Skull Demons. I know those bastards. They are a crazy bunch of fanatics, the best squadron of the NTF and, at present, the UPC. I pray I won't run into them.

My wingman, Greg Sanders, a bloke from the 107th Ravens and my former instructor, seemed eager enough. Fearless as he is and so sure about himself. He upholds the law like a banner and cherished his principles. A jolly old chap, always wearing a smile after a hard day's work. I wish I have his fervor. As for me, I am still discovering the path and getting to know this one side of the coin.
