The strike assault craft, GTSa Boreas is a very fast cruiser in its class. It is the smaller version of the Avenger. Boreas class cruisers have 2 long range Neutron Beam emitters and 2 Ion Cannons. This fire power makes them strong enough against shivan large vessels. Six Boreas cruisers were deployed in the later stages of the Third Shivan War and complemented the Strike Group Alpha. The information about the construction, blueprint design, and the developers of these vessels is being held as top secret at the highest level by the Terran Assembly which caused quite a stir in the Vasudan Imperium and many kept wondering if we have these warships, why were they deployed late in the war when so many thousands have already died.
