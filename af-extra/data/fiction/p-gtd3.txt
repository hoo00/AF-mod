The GTD Hercules is the first 'Solaris' class destroyer to be built as one of the imperatives dictated by the 'Proteuz Mandate.' Much bigger than its cousin the Erebus class, it sports 9 GRV Beam cannons and 12 Novatron and Polaris torpedo launchers with multiple positron cannons, proton blasters and flak guns. A significant addition to the 7th Battlegroup. Uniquely of Adharan design just like its sister ship, the Galileo, this destroyer was not built for good looks. Its intimidating appearance only shows its capacity to nullify multiple large Shivan vessels. The blueprints for the GTD Hercules was actually drafted before the Excelsior was constructed but its construction was delayed to make way for the development of the Titan and the Erebus class.
