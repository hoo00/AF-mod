The last addition to the 7th Battlegroup is the 'Tiger' class tactical strike vessel, The GTCv Copernicus. It is a long range frontal assault and torpedo platform armed with 2 heavy Mk 2 Gravimetric Beam cannons, 4 Antimatter dual-cannons, and 6 Novatron and Polaris torpedo launchers with a score of defense turrets. Initially, the GTVA High Command wanted a much smaller but fully armed frigate so that it won't be a logistic burden and capable of quick deployment but the end result was a heavy corvette. They wanted to scrap the designs but its construction was already under way so they decided to push through with it and later tested it. It actually slightly out-performed the chimera class. However, the Copernicus' greatest strength is also its weakness. The frontal placement of its main cannons and their narrow field of view makes it quite vulnerable to flanking attackers.
