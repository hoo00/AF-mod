The GTC Bajoran is a torpedo cruiser specially constructed for the SOC. Armed with 4 Novatron torpedo launchers, it is a silent killer that can stalk the enemy and destroy it from a distance. The plans for this cruiser was drafted just a few months after the end of the First Shivan War but its construction was delayed to pave way for the production of the Deimos class corvette. Eventually, the project was shut down. But with the emergence of the United Pirate Coalition, a 'quiet' assault was needed as a tactic to shun the pirate's operations.
