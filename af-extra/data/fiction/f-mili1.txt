The GTF Falcon is a new light space superiority fighter manufactured exclusive for the 7th Battlegroup as laid down by the Proteuz Mandate. It handles very well in dogfight situations and it packs a fire power similar to the Dark Angel. Although it has only one missile bank, it does have a huge payload. It is issued to new pilots drafted to the 77th and 76th Squadrons as a starter ship to hone their close combat skills. These new pilots have to earn enough elite points before they can use the standard issue.
