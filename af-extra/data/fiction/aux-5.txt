The GTT Damascus is a fully armed transport built at the Adhara shipyards. Armed with 10 gun turrets, 2 torpedo batteries and 5 mounted frontal mass drivers with some weapons unique to the Adharan people. The purpose of these arsenal is clear. The passengers of this ship are the planetary government officials and even the Adharan chancellor himself. Many of the GTVA personnel would not even believe that this craft is a civilian vessel as it is much deadlier than the standard Aeolus class cruiser.
