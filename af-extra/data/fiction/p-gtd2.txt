This new carrier has more fighter craft capacity than any of the GTVA's older carriers. Given the collapsible configuration of the new class of assault fighters, it can easily house five hundred units in its cavernous hangar bays. Armed with a mighty triple array of heavy gravimetric spinal beams, a battery of positron cannons, proton blasters, and Novatron torpedoes, the Titan can outgun two Hecate destroyers and outmaneuver the enemy with its remarkable speed and offensive capabilities. And unlike a typical carrier like the Aquitaine that would normally stay at the rear of an engagement, this destroyer can be deployed at the frontlines in some of the fiercest battles.
