After contemplating the enormous losses of the Second Great War, even after developing the first prototype destroyers and corvettes, the GTVA researchers decided again to experiment with corvette-sized warships so powerfully armed they would give even Shivan destroyers pause. The prototype GTCv Serenity, a 'Lion' class corvette, was the result. It is fully armed with a staggering arsenal of 3 heavy Gravimetric Beam Cannons, 6 slashing Gravimetric Emitters, 4 'Polaris' torpedo batteries and a heavy Antimatter cannon outgunning the other prototype corvettes. Because of the power consumption of its multiple beam weapons, it has fewer defensive turrets. A couple of fighter wings will compensate for its lack of defense.
