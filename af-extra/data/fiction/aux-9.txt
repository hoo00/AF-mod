This cruiser-sized medical and rescue vessel that is specially constructed and commissioned to the 7th Battlegroup houses state-of-the-art medical facilities capable of treating thousands of wounded who are in need of immediate attention before transporting them to the Enterprise. While the vessel is moderately armored using advanced armor plating, it only has minimal defensive weaponry. As such, the Odyssey should receive priority fighter cover in case enemy contact is expected.
