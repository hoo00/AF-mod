After the successful development of the 'Titan' class destroyer-carrier, the GTVA had begun designing and construction of a new class of warship built solely for quick squadron deployment, a 'Nova' class carrier. The Nova carrier's hangar has almost double the capacity as that of the Titan. Although this vessel can outrun any of the GTVA prototypes, this is not an offensive warship and the purpose of its impressive speed is evasion and rapid strategic positioning. Even though the ship's armaments lacked flak guns, anti-fighter Beam emitters and beam weapons, this warship cannot be underestimated for it does have 6 heavy antimatter quad cannons and a defensive array of 44 dual-mounted heavy turrets. During the Third Shivan War, it was deployed with the 8th SOC Battlegroup to the Mutara Nebula for combing operations.
