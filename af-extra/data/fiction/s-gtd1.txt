This destroyer's design is actually the first iteration drafted by the Armada Division in the development of a super destroyer that came to be the Erebus Class. The Sovereign was supposed to be the candidate to be one of the the GTVA Prototypes but the Weapons Division's new arsenal such as the Gravimetetric Beam Cannon and the new Pulse defense turrets were 'power-hungry' that required the new neutrino reactors and the Sovereign failed to meet the structural requisite to house these massive reactors. And so, like the GTCv Rigel, the Raynor class failed the bid to be equipped with the latest weaponry. The project leader of the committee formed by the 'Proteuz Mandate' was furious about this obvious lack of synchronicity between the two departments and demanded a new design from the Armada Division. The Raynor project, however was not scrapped. Given the enormous budget already spent for the Sovereign's development, it would be a waste for throwing the blueprints in the trash bin so they proceeded in its mass construction and deployed two hundred of these destroyers along with the launching of the new Sirona warships. Although it is only armed with standard offensive weapons, it is still a formidable warship armed with 8 heavy beam cannons, 6 long range torpedo launchers and numerous Mark 2 Plasma turret defenses and anti-fighter beams.
