Conceived in the early 2360s, the Damocles class was intended as a ship of exploration, filling a niche that had been largely vacant since the Great War. With internal storage compartments capable of sustaining operations for a year without resupply, and onboard repair and maintenance facilities for its three squadrons of fighters, the Damocles boasted an unprecedented level of self-sufficiency, and was rapidly green lit by the Security Council. 

The first vessel, the GTD Damocles itself, was launched in the last weeks of the NTF Rebellion, but it was not commissioned until several months later, and saw no action during either the Rebellion or the Second Shivan Incursion. With the renewed Shivan threat, and the resulting decrease in enthusiasm for exploration, the Damocles is attached to the 8th SOC Battlegroup.
