When the military began launching new warships to replace the aging ones, most notably the Orions whose design is already almost four decades old, the military decommissioned the outdated models to pave the way for newer class of destroyers. Normally, retired vessels are dismantled and stripped down for recycling but in this case where the Terrans are deep in debt because of the Post-Capella recovery and the enormous budget required to impose the Proteuz Mandate, the Terran military sold these crafts to private corporations and even to rich individuals. Unknowingly, they signed their own death warrants. The UPC, having infiltrated and influenced several big companies, purchased these ships through 'back channeling' and delivered them secretly to their shipyards in Deneb to be modified. One of their creations is the Refitted Orion. Made of three Orions merged into one, this destroyer turned out to be a colossal threat to society.
