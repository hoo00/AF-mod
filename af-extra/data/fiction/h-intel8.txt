The SC Lamia is a newly discovered Shivan cruiser that acts as a communications craft. Fighter pilots are well advised to let the corvettes and destroyers take care of these cruisers. Armed with many flak batteries and anti-fighter beams, it can tear any fighter and bomber apart. It is also armed with a beam cannon that can easily take care of cruisers. Its main weakness is a poorly armed rear, with no special weaponry and any ship that is able to flank the Lamia, is spared from the brunt of its firepower.
