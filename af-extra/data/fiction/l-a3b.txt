Epsilon Pegasi

So that's how it is. The life of an elite pilot. To lay down your life at the mercy of your superior's bidding. We are like grains to feed the chickens, being thrown into the mix in the middle of pandemonium. I had been a GTVA pilot before but my sorties were nothing compared to this. Even my fellow recruits who are good pilots themselves were catatonic after the experience. Greg Sanders on the other hand, who was also drafted, wears his usual grin... How does he do that? I'm still twitching every time I remember the explosions, plasma streaks, the missile lock warnings and the deafening sound of those gravimetric beams. The men from the 76th Ice Queens were laughing. They said it's just the first. As warriors of the 7th Battlegroup, we are supposed to be outnumbered; a wing pitted against a full squadron --- an absurd ratio. Hell, it made a tough mercenary mission looked like a baby-sitting job. It's suicide! The way of a Dark Angel is life balancing on a thread.
