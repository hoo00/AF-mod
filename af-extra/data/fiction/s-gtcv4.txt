The GTCv Comet is an attempt to fill the gap between cruisers and destroyers in GTA fleets, effectively reducing the odds in situations where cruisers would in serious danger and the deployment of a destroyer would be too much. Comet-class corvettes are fast and armed with many medium and heavy turrets, which justify the high priority given to them by hostile forces during battles. There are usually two of them forming escort with their flagship, and can jump to support engaged forces in a moment's notice. They have proved to be very good at protecting vital space installations and convoys. 

Small control facilities enable Comet corvettes to lead small groups of other ships if a destroyer is not present to provide logistical support, thus making the loss of such an important strategic tool a serious defeat for its fleet.
