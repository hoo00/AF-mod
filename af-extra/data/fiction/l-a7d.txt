Mutara Nebula
Knossos Sector

The Mutara Nebula seems to be quieter now. When I was in this place, the time we broke through that Shivan blockade, all I could hear were the cries of wounded pilots in the infirmary aboard the Titan. The many near-death instances that makes you want to forget who you are. All those shakings and tremors as the enemy were carving the up Titan's hull with their beams as if it were butter. It has been two days since we parked here near the Knossos and I am confronted with disbelief, my apprehensions were frustrated. The dreaded nebula had seemed to be a very peaceful place. Not a single incident. The Titan Battlegroup did not have a single encounter. But when we got orders to go back to Shiva, I could have sworn and called the gods of the cosmos and asked why. I didn't want to go back there again after that last crazy covert SOC mission. I know what's out there. I still had nightmares of that place.
