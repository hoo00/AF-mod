MISSION PROTOCOL 729

The information gathered from debriefings during the past two Shivan wars cited a number of desertions by GTVA pilots from the field of engagement. Some sorties even failed to meet their objectives because of these actions. Several pilots who cannot stand the pressure of combating a superior and overwhelming force have activated their jump drives and fled from the scene. Although these instances are quite uncommon, the action of even one pilot escaping his mission can have repercussions in the theater of war and even jeopardizing the entire campaign that could lead to defeat or worst, the death of millions. The GTVA High Command, after considering the possible ramifications, issued this protocol to the Terran-Vasudan military: No pilot is allowed to jump out from his mission without authorization. This high level directive was implemented immediately and it was a shock to the GTVA forces. Every military fighter was outfitted with a controller chip that will disable the jump engines until it will be activated remotely by mission control or CNC. The programming software is highly encrypted to prevent anyone from tampering with it. A few high ranking commanders including their proponent, Admiral Jennifer Cadeza, lobbied against this imperative and deemed this protocol as drastic, placing the very lives of pilots into hands of their commanding officers. She pointed out the possibility that a command ship might be destroyed and leaving the pilots stranded in a dire situation but High Command bluntly disregarded her views.
