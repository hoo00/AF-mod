The GTD Galileo is a 'Vexor' class destroyer that was last to be built for the 7th Battlegroup at the Adharan shipyards and being the last to be constructed, it is one of the three prototypes to be outfitted with the recently developed Antimatter Cannons and an array of 18 of these have proven to be deadly for hostile capital ships. While boasting only 2 GRV Beams, these weapons can pivot in their mount giving a field of view in all directions. During field tests, its performance was even in par with the Excelsior but occasionally suffers reactor overheating. The engineers are currently finding out ways to rectify this problem.
