Even before the unfortunate loss of the Colossus to the Shivans in the Capella system, GTVA designers sought to create a destroyer to make up for the shortcomings in the flagship's design concept of 'Bigger and Stronger', which resulted in 'More Expensive and Poorer Deployment Options'. The GTD Stromberg was an attempt to create a modern destroyer class warship capable of standing toe-to-toe with anything in its class the Shivans could throw at it. While the old Hecate class destroyers excelled as flagships and as command and control for fighter squadrons, the Hecate had failed to live up to the expectations in direct warship combat. Command chose to deploy Orion class destroyers alongside the Hecates to offset this weakness, but against the new Shivan threat, the Orion class destroyers were showing their age. The Stromberg picks up where the Orions left off, mounting heavy firepower, both in warship engagements and fighter defense. The massive arrays of heavy defense turrets and long range flak cannons make this 'Sirona' class destroyer a deathtrap for any bomber pilot who will attempt to engage it.
