The Excelsior is the first 'Erebus' class warship to be constructed. Spanning a length of almost 3 kilometers, this destroyer is a monolithic representation of destruction. It is heavily armed with multiple Gravimetric Beam emitters, long range Polaris torpedo launchers and a full array of heavy positron pulse cannons, light proton pulse blasters and Anti-Fighter Beam cannons and to supply its energy demands, the Excelsior is installed with the GTVA's newly developed Neutrino Reactors. Its hull utilizes the latest breakthrough in 'ablative armor' technology that can withstand a barrage of enemy offensives. The combat evaluators concluded that this ship will be able to engage and destroy an enemy destroyer in a matter of seconds. The Excelsior is the flagship of the 7th Battlegroup commanded by Admiral William Cartwright.
