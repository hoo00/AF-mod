Since the loss of the GTVA Colossus and the destruction of Capella, the GTVA Security Council has put the highest priority on the development and deployment of the most advanced weapons systems known. The latest warship to mount these weapons is the GTVA Archangel, a Colossus-scale Dreadnaught. This ship was built at a secret GTVA orbital shipyards in a remote location in Alpha Centauri. Its entire front superstructure is one gigantic Tachyon Beam emitter that is capable of nullifying any known threat in two shots, as well as 18 anti-capital ship tachyon beams. Only one have been completed so far though High Command hopes to have one in each operational battle fleet by the end of the decade. However, the Archangel Project was kept secret to the Vasudans and its first appearance in Gamma Draconis enraged some of the Vasudan members in the GTVA High Council.
