Shiva System

The war in Shiva rages on for almost five months and it seemed to go on forever. We had been serving under the 12th SOC Fleet after we lost the Excelsior, the Dark Angels and the Ice Queens, complementing the Jupiter's 57th Head Hunters---those pilots are suicidal and tight-lipped. It has been more than one year since the Shivans arrived and started The Third Shivan War. So much had happened. GTVA clashed with Shivan Forces. Fleet against fleet. In some places, we were winning, yet in some, we have lost many. Everything is on fire. The whole Shivan system is in total madness. The greatest battle we have ever fought. I have witnessed it all. But the future is not certain and I am left with one question. Will this be our last and our doom or will this be our glory and victory?
