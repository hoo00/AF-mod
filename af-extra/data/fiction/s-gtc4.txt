The SOC's Orca is the first of the next generation class of warships employed by the alliance, the 'Blade' class cruiser. The old cruisers carried too little firepower to cope with newer and larger warships, and didn't perform satisfactory against fighters either, so a new and larger warship was produced - the battlecruiser. Larger than a cruiser but smaller than a corvette, a battlecruiser combines the best from both. It has enough speed, firepower and armor to be a great asset on the battlefield.
