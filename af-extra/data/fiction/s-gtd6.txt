No information is known about this warship. The Vasudans intentionally withheld the specifications of this craft. According to our observations, this new destroyer is based on their perfected frame design of the GVC Anubis. We can only conclude that its weaponry is still the standard vasudan armament. It is equipped with several Meson Cannons and beam weapons. We have no data of its hull armor technology and its capabilities but we can assume that this warship is at par with new Terran destroyers.
