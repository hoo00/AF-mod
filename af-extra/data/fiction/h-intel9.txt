The SC Asura is a new cruiser introduced by the Shivans mid-phase in the Third Shivan War. The purpose of this craft is to lock all the elements in an engagement, to prevent losing GTVA ships from escaping. Apparently, this new Shivan tactic is our own fault. Our enemy observed the Charybdis AWACs employing vectoring interference signal to make it difficult for them to calculate their subspace jump in many missions since their third incursion most notably our recent operation to disrupt a Lamia Comms Craft in Gamma Draconis. The Shivans adopted this tactic to their own strategy but their technique is way too advance. Unlike our interference signal, the Asura sends off a massive inhibiting wave that shuts down our jump engines completely. In addition, this wave also weakens our beam weapons. This vessel is considered a priority target. Should one be encountered in an enemy fleet, it must destroyed first.
