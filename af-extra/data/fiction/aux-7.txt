Logistics vessels are the newest class of support vessels commissioned by the GTVA. These mammoth ships of Vasudan design serve as an all-around support ship, combining freight hauling capabilities with field repair stations and medical facilities. They also have the same 'ablative' armor technology as the GTVA Prototypes. They are indispensable assets for fleets engaged in critical operations where falling back to refit in a friendly outpost would be a disadvantage strategically. It is also important for task forces assigned in missions far from any GTVA installations.
