Being a mercenary is not all killing and destroying stuff. Sometimes, I get the opportunity to be on the side of the law. Strangely, it felt good like I have a definite purpose in life and not just earning your way out of the hardships and enjoying the fruits of your labor. There are things greater than luxuries. Not until now, I have realized this. Perhaps, it is time to take my existence to the next level.

I'm going to Vega and see what is in store for me there.
