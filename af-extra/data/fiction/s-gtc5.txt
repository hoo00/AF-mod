Learning from the brutal wars of the Second Shivan Incursion and the emergence of an organized criminal syndicate known as the United Pirate Coalition, the need of a light and fast armed vessel capable of harassing enemy crafts and screening maneuvers is vital for combat situations. The Adharan government being one of the leading manufacturers of new warships for the GTVA, began developing and mass producing these ships. Although it will not stand against bigger ships in a head to head battle, its agility and point defense capabilities will give it a fair chance against beam attacks and assault wings.
