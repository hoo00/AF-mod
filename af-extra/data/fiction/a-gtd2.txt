The GTDc Warlock is a prototype super carrier which is one of the largest space-faring warships ever constructed. Over 4.8 kilometers long, its vast hangar can accommodate more than 100 wings of fighters and bombers. In addition, the Warlock is armed with heavy plasma beam weapons, enabling it to engage several hostile destroyers at once. It was completed just shortly before the Third Shivan War and it existence was kept secret until the invasion of Shiva was contemplated. Although this craft was not field-tested, the GTVA council commission it to push the Shivans back into their home system.
