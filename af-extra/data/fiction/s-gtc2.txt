The GTC Khitomer is the new 'Shield' class cruiser constructed under the new military doctrine regarding the common role of cruisers. This warship is bristling with gun turrets and can unleash a murderous storm of plasma to any attacking fighter which makes up for the lack of any beam weapons or heavy offensive cannons. This cruiser is primarily deployed for screening maneuvers, blanket operations and escort sorties. In strike missions, a pair of these is deployed to go alongside a 'blade' class cruiser or a 'comet' class corvette to increase the survivability of the assaulting craft.
