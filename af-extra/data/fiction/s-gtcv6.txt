The GTCv Rigel was an attempt to down-size an Orion class destroyer. Unfortunately, its outdated space frame was not designed to accommodate the power reactors developed for new corvettes. Still it is armed 4 heavy beam cannons and fortified with very strong armor. The GTCv Rigel was actually the first candidate to field test the new pulse weapons but that did not fare well because of the power demands of the new weapons.
