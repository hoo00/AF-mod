NEW FLEET DESIGNATION

The 'Battlegroup' designation was adopted to the present war doctrine when the military accumulated an incredibly large number of new destroyers, corvettes and cruisers. The formation is composed of a flagship destroyer (Raynor Class), a multi-role destroyer (Sirona Class), a support destroyer (Raven Class), and a carrier (Nova Class). This destroyer group is backed by four new corvettes and six new cruisers of which can be any of the newer classes depending on what the fleet is specialized in whether it is a front line force, flanking assault, a follow-through unit, or an extended task force which in this case requires a logistic vessel. The war advisers and analysts are confident that this profile can prosecute an objective with excessive lethal force. 

The old fleet groups currently active, typically comprised of two Hecates and six Deimoses and several Aeolus cruisers, like the 3rd Fleet were not abolished and still retained their designation as 'Fleet.' But their group will not be appended and this type of formation will no longer be used. And should they incur severe losses, their fleet will be decommissioned, its surviving ships will be sold and the entire officers and crew will be reassigned to new or existing battle groups. An example of this is the dissolution of the 11th Fleet under Admiral Cartwright when it suffered severe losses in an encounter with a massive UPC force. The surviving officers and crew were transferred to the newly formed 7th Battlegroup.
