The Adamant is the second prototype next-generation cruiser and two were brought into service to complement the 7th battlegroup. The GTVA decided that tactical assault cruisers are needed to enhance military combat strategy. It is armed with 2 long ranged tactical GRV beam cannons and 2 slashing GRV beams. This craft is mainly used to weaken enemy fleet from a distance beyond their beam range before the main allied fleet move in to engage. Despite of its arsenal, it is weakly defended by a mere 4 turrets and 4 missile batteries. It is often paired with a 'Vigilant' class cruiser or covered by two fighter wings. Its subsystems are highly advanced and its experimental neutrino reactor provides a huge power output to complement its weapons.
