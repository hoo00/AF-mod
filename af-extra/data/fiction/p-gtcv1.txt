The GTCv Capella was the first 'Chimera' class multi-role corvettes to be constructed just two and a half years after the Second Shivan War along with the first Erebus class and the Titan class carrier filling the role of anti-ship combat and destroyer escort admirably. Three anti-capital ship beams and several short-ranged turrets provide significant firepower with a surplus of reactor energy to provide an appreciable boost in speed. Designed as part of an initiative to mimic Shivan tactics and provide overwhelming anti-warship firepower, the Capella is a welcome addition to the 7th Battlegroup.
