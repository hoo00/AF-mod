In the development of this new corvette, several Terran engineers volunteered for this project as a gesture of goodwill but their actual intention for this move was to secretly gain information to the Vasudan hull technology as they were hesitant to share them with the Terrans. However, it was proven to be an unsuccessful clandestine effort because the ship's hull segments and modules were built in a separate facility that is devoid of workers other than Vasudans. The samples taken from the components were even useless. The fabrication technique of the new armor is beyond human comprehension. Nevertheless, the Terran volunteers continued with their work. The result is a multi-role hybrid, a Vasudan corvette with Terran guns. This battle wagon can operate offensively and tactically capable of slugging the enemy at close range and hammering a hostile warship at a distance with a barrage of Hornviper torpedoes.
