Like its sister ship, the GTL Enterprise, this massive logistic ship has the same freight hauling stations, repair bays, medical facilities and gigantic storage compartments also serving to fleet with extended assignments. Although the ship shares the same specification as that of the Enterprise, the Opulence is of Terran construction. The Vasudans were pretty disturb about the Terran's push to develop their own version as it was clearly redundant. But the human agenda is obvious. The Terran Assembly planned to use these ships to support the construction of their portal to Earth. Another reason for the Vasudans to scorn the humans.
