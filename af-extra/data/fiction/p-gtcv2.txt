The Prototype GTCv Olympus is the heavy 'Bellerophon' class corvette. Her abilities are similar to that of the lighter Chimera class, Reaper class and the heavier Tiger class, but more reactor power has been diverted towards weapons systems to provide an increase in firepower. An Mk 2 GRV beam system and a pair of lighter Mk 3 GRV beams give it massive anti-warship firepower, and working alongside other members of a battlegroup, it can annihilate Shivan destroyers in seconds. The result is a slower but better-armed variant with new hull plating taking advantage of breakthroughs in armor research.
