After decades of distinguished service, the Elysium class of transports were showing their age, and a sturdier replacement was needed. Thus the Corsair was born. While larger than the old Elysium, it is still dwarfed by the GTVA tactical transport, Argo. The Corsair is better equipped to defend itself, however. In the past 18 months, the Corsair has proved itself to be a reliable transport even in the heat of battle, conducting high-risk marine insertions.
