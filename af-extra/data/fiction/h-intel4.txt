There is a single word to describe the Shivan command craft, and that it is a 'monster'. An obscenely, heavily armed weapons platform, this super destroyer wields four massive heavy beam cannons and nine long range beams which can destroy one of our capital ships in a few hits. With eight full fighter squadrons and a full array of defensive turrets, the Bhaal would be extremely difficult to destroy in a normal situation. This warship is responsible of coordinating the Shivan fleets in the Shivan home system. 

We have no way of knowing if there is more than one Bhaal-class destroyer. However, any that exist should be considered more dangerous than a Class A threat.
