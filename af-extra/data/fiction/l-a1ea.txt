Beta Aquilae

They say that discounts are good in Beta Aquilae. I'm heading over there now. To get a taste of civilization after spending most of the time in space for weeks. At least now, I can have the luxury of enjoying myself after the hard work and earning those hard-earned cash. I'm glad that the space winds are in my favor. After those long years of being down on my luck. Well, it’s also my opportunity to replenish my supplies. It's indeed a good day. One man told me once, “don't spend it in one place.”
