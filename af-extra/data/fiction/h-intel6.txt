The SCV Diablo is a deadly hostile craft first encountered when four of these attempted to lay waste one of the 7th BG destroyers. According to the After-Combat report of Admiral Richards, this corvette can cloak itself with a jamming field that prevents long range weapon locks until it is very close which is fatal as it is also fitted with a Sathanas-grade beam emitter. The SCv Diablo, as dangerous as it is, has weaknesses. The targeting of its 'weapons' subsystem can disrupt it, the destruction of its 'jamming emitter' can render it open to attack at long range and the elimination of its main forward beam will destroy this ship. This corvette is rarely seen but we are not certain if there are more of them out there
