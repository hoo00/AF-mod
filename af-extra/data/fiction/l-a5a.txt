Mutara Nebula

We have manage to escape the Shivan home system. It was insane! But it was worst here in Mutara. The moment we had breached the dimensional threshold, we encountered many hostile forces. The 3rd Fleet, 9th Fleet and the 2nd Battlegroup were no long guarding the Knossos. They fell back to Gamma Draconis. We were left alone to fend for ourselves. The Shivans were really chasing us. Almost every hour, we had to scramble to the hangar in order to defend the Titan and the Babylon. Both ships are now badly damaged and repair supplies are running low. Two hours ago, we were able to hold off 2 Shivan fleet. It was short of a miracle. We had been making hop jumps from sector to sector and every time we settle to normal space, the Shivans were waiting. Except for the last two jumps. We haven't encountered a single attack. That's good, I guess. My pilots needed their respite and they are sleeping in their bunks this minute. I want to take a short nap but I can't close my eyes, not with this feeling I have. Something is not right. My inner voice echoes his warning over and over again---I have to shut off this resounding babble because I must rest now. I cannot be effective in battle in this tired state. Well... There is always a solution to this...The sleeping pill.
