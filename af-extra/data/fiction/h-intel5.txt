A new type of Shivan destroyer encountered by a rescue group in Sector GD28, Gamma Draconis that destroyed the GTCv Astron. Although the corvette's confrontation with the Garuda was brief and ended up with its untimely demise, the Astron was able to obtain a tactical scan of the unknown destroyer and sent to HQ via regular telemetry burst transmissions. According to the data readings and combat analysis, the Garuda is more powerful than the Ravana and Demon, bristling with offensive weaponry with three frontal heavy beams, an aft short range beam and 10 red emitters, a new kind of weapon that sends successive bolts of unknown energy that may be analogous to our Antimatter and Meson Cannons but very destructive to our subsystems. It is also slightly faster than any Shivan destroyer and quite maneuverable. The survivors brought back by the medical vessel, Odyssey witnessed several of these working in unison decimating the 10th Battlegroup and almost wiped out the 5th BG and 12th S O C Fleet. It is not certain whether this warship is an improved replacement of the Ravana or this class belongs to their back line reserves and recently sent to the front. Regardless, High Command has issued a Priority One directive to these hostile destroyers should we encounter any one of them.
