The GTT Cradle is a new class of light transport. Although it won't effectively replace the Argo, it is mostly preferred for its gun mounts. It is widely used for military insertions to capture smaller warships even corvettes. There was, actually, one time a Cradle transport, boarded with heavily armed elite SOC Special Forces, was able to seize command of an Orion class destroyer from the United Pirate coalition. The incident gave the ship an elevated status.
