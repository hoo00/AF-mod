The production project of the GTc Hestia started shortly after the Capella incident in order to combine power emergence and low cost in the post - war GTVA territories. Originally designed as a large freighter, It was only matter of time for it to be noticed that her body shape was ideal for accommodating a fair amount of fighter/bomber squadrons and deploy them were the presence of a destroyer was strategically not effective, or simply too expensive. After the essential arrangements, Hestia was presented as a Tactical Carrier but left any other impression than that. It was from the test flights that her crew members found her heavy, slow, hard to manoeuver and poorly armed. Yet, despite her 'piece of junk' performance and appearance, Hestias can easily carry and support 24 fighters/bombers for long hauls and this particular attribute promises her a key role to the aggrieved GTVA fleet. She is also offered to civilian buyers under the permission of the GTVA military for private defense purposes against raiders and pirates.
