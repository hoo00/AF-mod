The GTC Hyperion was developed shortly after the Second Shivan Incursion just after the ratification of the 'Proteuz Mandate' as a test bed for the new neutrino reactors and pulse weapon technologies. The Hyperion combines the anti-fighter capabilities and speed of the Aeolus and the armor of the Leviathan. As such, the Hyperion is a formidable target for strike craft to engage. The GTC Hyperion was the first Terran ship to mount new pulse weaponry and the first Gravimetric Beams although non-military Hyperion class cruisers are equipped with standard beam weapons only. The success of the ship's development paved the way for the construction of the GTVA prototypes. The Hyperion is rapidly filling the ranks of the GTVA, phasing out earlier cruiser models. One of these ships was loaned to Britonia Police Precinct in Vega.
