There is limited information regarding the full specification of this rare custom-made interceptor but it appears that the XJR Phantom is a heavily armed and heavily armored high-performance civilian interceptor. Apparently, this craft can outrun and outgun almost any other fighter class including the GTVA Prototypes and supposedly unrivalled in its ability to perform surgical strike missions on most well-defended targets. There are many speculations how this ship came to be. One of the rumors that is considered implausible relates to a Black Ops project by the Armada Division where its design was stolen by the UPC and sold to a wealthy client who secretly constructed this ship then later lost it in a game of X-Poker. The official story in our records states that the Phantom was built by a private contractor who failed his bid to the military as this design suffers an occasional lock-up in its weapons system. However, we will maintain a degree of interest to this craft and we will find the means to acquire it legally. Should any military pilot or police enforcer encounter this interceptor, report any observations regarding its capabilities but do not engage unless it is absolutely necessary.
