Gamma Draconis

I went to the debriefing room and found nobody there. I thought I was late but apparently, our Flight Division Commander dismissed the pilots immediately. Greg Sanders told me that the man was rather shaken, just wave the pilots away the moment they stepped through the door. I think it's not about the seemingly endless attack from the Shivans. We are already way too callous for that. It is the new standing imperative from High Command, 'Order 66.' This protocol that extend not only to the military but to civilians as well. Our superiors sending our own to their deaths. One of the destroyers from the 6th Fleet self-detonated to ensure the destruction of another Lucifer destroyer a few days past. A Hippocrates medicaft, the GTM Amara, on a rescue mission rammed a Shivan Asmodeus freighter that happened to be in the location, killing everyone onboard including the wounded patients. Fleet Net is full of these news feeds. I am pretty disturbed. Are we all expendable? Is this who we are now? We are beginning to be like the Shivans. This war have shaved off a part of our humanity. And what about those civilians aboard the Pandora gas miners? The price of fuel is high indeed. It costs thousands of lives.
