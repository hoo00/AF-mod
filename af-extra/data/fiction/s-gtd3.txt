The GTD Excalibur, a 'Raven' class support destroyer, was launched almost at the same time as its sister ship, the GTD Stromberg. This warship wields 2 long range heavy beam cannons and 2 medium range beams with a score of point defenses and anti-fighter turrets. The Excalibur does not have any fighter bays as it is built solely for heavy assault. This battleship is often paired with a 'Sirona' multi-role destroyer to deliver the full effect of an offensive barrage on an enemy fleet. Complemented with a 'Nova' carrier and a 'Raynor' flagship, this group of warships is formidable. The GTVA High Command has recently implemented this type of fleet formation to task forces designated as 'Battlegroup' as this is most effective in nullifying large hostile fleet.
