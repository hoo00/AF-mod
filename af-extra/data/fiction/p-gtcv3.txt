The GTCv Babylon is a 'Reaper' class corvette prototype commissioned for the 7th Battlegroup. At this point in time the GTVA analyst in the war department are not yet definitive in their overall military doctrine even with the huge data collected in their battle assessments. Shivan tactics are extremely unpredictable. So to solve this dilemma on what type of warships to develop, the basis for new designs must cover a larger scope. Each corvette prototype served a different purpose. The Capella for quick attack, the Olympus for heavy assault, the Copernicus for long range war tactics and the Serenity as a heavy weapons platform. The Babylon was built for destroyer escort, fleet support and space installation defense
