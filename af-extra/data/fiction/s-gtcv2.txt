RNI systems and Ahketon Corporation collaborated to produce an Arpyia class corvette based on demands from the GTVA High Council requesting a tactical rapid response craft with carrier capability. Taking notes from the design of the successful Deimos class corvette, the first Arpyia class elegantly integrates a large fighter bay into its well-rounded frame. But Unlike the regular GTVA corvettes, which were intended for large fleet maneuvers where flanks were secured and overwhelming forward firepower was required, the Coronis is a versatile strike craft designed for independent operations. The first Arpyia class vessels were launched two years after the Capella incident.
