Once the Proteuz Mandate was ratified, the Vasudans began developing a new type of cruiser that will serve as a base design for their new bigger warships. This ship's performance was excellent during computer simulated tests and in a year's time, more than 2 dozens of these warships have been deployed to full combat status and, at present, they have hundreds of these. Outfitted with new upgraded meson reactors and strong armor, it is fast and deadly. This cruiser is heavily armed than the older cruiser model, equipped with 2 Meson Cannons, 1 beam cannon and a full battery of 19 defensive turrets.
