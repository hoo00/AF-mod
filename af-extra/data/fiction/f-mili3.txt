The GTF Dark Angel, GTVA's latest multi-role advance assault fighter. The young engineers in the Armada Division didn't adhere to the conventional dogma in ship design. These bright minds revised the old space frames and put them to a whole new level. The new configuration they conceived enabled the new design to perform multiple functions instead of specializing in one. Many veteran pilots dreamed of spacecraft that is a jack of all trades and save them from the predicament of having to choose which type of ship to use in a particular sortie. The Dark Angel is remarkably agile with enough gun banks to make it a space superiority fighter. Its excellent speed makes it a formidable interceptor while its ultra-heavy Duranium armor, advanced shielding, a wide range of weapon compatibility and large payload will turn it into an intimidating assault craft all packed with new power generators, sensor package and the latest emergency systems and counter measures. Exclusively manufactured for the ultra-modern fleet, the 7th Battlegroup.
