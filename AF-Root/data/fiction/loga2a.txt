Vega System $}

After that prison break in Beta Aquilae, I had a moment of compulsion to take the police chief's offer. It is ridiculous. I don't want to be in that mess again. I don't want the pressure. My life is better like this, just a freelancer. It's that voice again. My hands were steering towards the node to Vega. My mind tells me not to but I could not overcome the urge which is getting stronger. Am I losing my grey matter? Am I going crackers? It seems that I am two sandwiches short of a picnic! So I surrendered to the whisper and went along like a falling leaf gliding in the autumn breeze.

I arrived at Andromeda Station a few hours later. Robert Prescott was pleased to see me. He wasted no time and took me right away to the medical labs for screening then the mind boggling aptitude exams and the interviews. I passed them all! Now, how was that? I was not good at tests, a miserable tail-ender as a military cadet though I was already a good pilot. It felt like someone took over. The words from my mouth and the letters I typed were clearly not mine. I'm not that eloquent. But as I said before, I will go along and see what happens.
