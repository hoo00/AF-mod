$B{Personal Log:
July 14,2371
Mutara Nebula $}

We have been sweeping the nebula for how many days now. My strike group is holding it together extremely well. These ships have tremendous fire power. I could not believe it myself until we have seen Shivan destroyers fell into our ion cannons. It was not even a battle. It was buffet of targets, a bloodbath. I wonder what the Shivans are thinking now. We were placed in the front line with the GTVA fleet just behind us and they have not even fired their beam cannons. We shredded those Ravanas, Garudas and Demons within seconds as more of them jumped in to intercept us. I was a sight to see. An awesome display of arsenal. After those days have passed, we anchored in the vicinity of the Knossos. Well, I can say that the only enemy of Strike Group Alpha is wear and tear. We have busted parts and components, burnt ion actuator coils and washed out ship commanders. The strike group was forced to the sidelines for now. So the battle groups went ahead of us together with the biggest super carrier ever built, the Warlock, in the hope of destroying the blockade that may have been or certainly set up there. Now, as I lay here in my bunk contemplating, if we build more Boreas and Avengers, we will have the power that will easily brush aside any alien civilization or submit them to our will. This thought scares me.
